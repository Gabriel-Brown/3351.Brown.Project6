   Hash tables are best suited for speed of finding things in the table.  They are much faster at finding things as compaired to 

B-Trees or 2-3-4 Trees.  B-Trees and 2-3-4 Trees are best suited for storing data in sorted order.  Hash Tables on the other hand 

cannot keep data in order so if that is a trait that you are looking for use another method.  I like B-Trees better than the

2-3-4 Trees as the code complexity and overhead is much smaller than that of the 2-3-4 Tree.
  
   Overall I would have to say that no single data type is better than the other.  They all have their specific use cases and 

specific advantages and disadvantages over the other types.
