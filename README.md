  Hash tables are best suited for speed of finding things in the table.  They are much faster at finding things as compaired to
B-Trees or 2-3-4 Trees.  B-Trees and 2-3-4 Trees are best suited for storing data in sorted order.  I like B-Trees better than 2-3-4 Trees as the code complexity and overhead is much smaller than that of the 2-3-4 Tree
